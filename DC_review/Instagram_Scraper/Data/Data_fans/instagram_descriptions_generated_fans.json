Axar, with Delhi Capitals since 2019, was its top retention for Rs 16.50 crore ahead of the 2024 mega auction. Though lacking extensive captaincy experience, he was India’s T20I vice-captain in January 2025. He has led Gujarat in 23 matches, including the Syed Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare Trophies.  Axar captained DC once last season, losing a match to RCB. He enters IPL 2025 after a key role in India’s Champions Trophy win, excelling with both bat and ball.  The team will kick off its campaign against the Lucknow Super Giants in Visakhapatnam on March 24.",

I witnessed something truly unforgettable on 27th April 2025.  As someone who is a Delhi Capitals fan through and through, my heart was, of course, rooting for them. Even though the total wasn’t massive, the way DC kept fighting for every ball was inspiring to watch.  And yet, sitting there in the stands, I couldn’t help but be in complete awe of how Bangalore turned their game around.  Bangalore stumbled early — 25/3 in 4.1 overs. Most would have thought it’s over. But that’s when true character shines through.  Virat Kohli and Krunal Pandya rebuilt the innings with quiet determination. They didn’t let a collapse define them. They stayed. They fought. They won.  And somewhere amidst the roars of the crowd, I realized — this is life.  You’ll fall. You’ll get bowled over. Life will throw impossible situations. But as long as you show up, fight back, and trust your process, you’re already winning.  This match wasn’t just about cricket. It was a masterclass in resilience and sportsmanship.  Here’s to never giving up — no matter what the scoreboard says.  Picture Credits: Photos sourced from the official Instagram pages of Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore.",
